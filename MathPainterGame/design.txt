Title: Math Painting
Description: An app that lets the user provide the start coordinates of geometrical shapes such as
squares and rectangles, their dimensions, and their colors, and the program produces an image file canvas with all
the geometrical shapes drawn in it.
Objects: Square:
            x
            y
            side
            color
            draw(canvas)
         Rectangle:
            x
            y
            width
            height
            color
            draw(canvas)
         Canvas:
            width
            height
            color
            make(imagepath)

Print Statements:
"Enter canvas width: "
"Enter canvas height: "
"Enter canvas color (white or black): "
"What do you like to draw? Enter quit to quit: "
   # Program only draws rectangles or squares
"Enter x of the rectangle: "
   # Coordinates in Python start in the upper left corner (0, 0)
"Enter y of the rectangle: "
"Enter the width of the rectangle: "
"Enter the height of the rectangle: "
"How much red should the rectangle have: "
"How much green: "
"How much blue: "
   # RGB ranges to determine color of the rectangle
"What do you like to draw? Enter quit to quit: "
"Enter x of the square: "
"Enter y of the square: "
"Enter the side length of the square: "
